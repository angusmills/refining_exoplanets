Refining the periods of transisting exoplanets

Aims may be:
1) to use new light-curves from HATSouth project to refine periods of exoplanets originally found by WASP project.
2) investigate transit timing variation (TTV) caused by nearby planets affecting the orbit of the exoplanet of interest
3) using residuals from exoplanet models, look for potential other planets transisting over the same star
